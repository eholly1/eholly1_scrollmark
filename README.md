# @treehut Social Media Analytics Project

## Project Goals

This project analyzes Instagram engagement data for @treehut to provide actionable insights across five key social media management objectives:

• **1. Brand Awareness & Reach** - Grow follower base and expand brand visibility in the beauty/skincare space

• **2. Community Building & Engagement** - Foster loyal customer relationships and create authentic product conversations

• **3. Sales & Conversion** - Drive traffic and convert social engagement into purchases

• **4. Customer Insights & Feedback** - Gather product feedback and identify market expansion opportunities

• **5. Brand Reputation Management** - Monitor sentiment and maintain consistent brand voice

## Approach

Using the `engagements.csv` dataset containing Instagram post metadata and user comments from March 2025, we will:

- **Define metrics & visualize** to measure performance and track progress
- **Provide insights** about customer behavior and preferences for each goal area
- **Generate actionable feedback** for social media strategy optimization

The analysis bridges marketing intent with customer reality, enabling data-driven decisions that move business metrics beyond vanity engagement numbers.

## Insights & Recommendations

### Brand Awareness & Reach

• **Strategic post types drive exponential reach** - PR recruitment posts (3,294 comments) and giveaways (201 avg) vastly outperform regular content (50 avg), with opportunity-based content generating the highest engagement. **Recommendation:** Balance content calendar with regular giveaways and periodic PR/influencer recruitment campaigns.

• **Timing maximizes visibility** - Peak engagement occurs at 7-8 PM (2,113 and 1,502 comments respectively), providing optimal scheduling for high-impact content. **Recommendation:** Reserve this prime window for giveaways, PR campaigns, and major announcements.

### Customer Insights & Recommendations

• **Berry scents represent massive untapped demand** - Only 2 berry-scented posts generated 45 comments per post, the highest engagement rate of any scent category, indicating significant market opportunity. **Recommendation:** Prioritize berry scent line expansion and test market response with limited releases.

• **Product category hierarchy reveals customer preferences** - Lotions (29.8 comments/post) and oils (23.2 comments/post) significantly outperform scrubs (15.9 comments/post), suggesting customers prioritize hydration over exfoliation. **Recommendation:** Shift product development and marketing focus toward moisturizing products.
  - *See: Average Engagement by Product Type chart*

• **International expansion opportunity clearly signaled** - Customer comments explicitly request product availability in other markets, with Canada being the most frequently mentioned. **Recommendation:** Conduct market research for international expansion, starting with Canada.
  - *See: Comment "Please carry these in Canada! I miss them so much!" (media_id: 1098364052333950)*

• **Vanilla market saturation evident** - Despite 40 vanilla-related posts, engagement averages only 7.9 comments per post, the lowest among major scent categories, indicating customer fatigue. **Recommendation:** Reduce vanilla content frequency and explore fresh scent profiles to re-energize the product line.
