# @treehut Social Media Analytics Project

## Project Goals

This project analyzes Instagram engagement data for @treehut to provide actionable insights across five key social media management objectives:

• **1. Brand Awareness & Reach** - Grow follower base and expand brand visibility in the beauty/skincare space

• **2. Community Building & Engagement** - Foster loyal customer relationships and create authentic product conversations

• **3. Sales & Conversion** - Drive traffic and convert social engagement into purchases

• **4. Customer Insights & Feedback** - Gather product feedback and identify market expansion opportunities

• **5. Brand Reputation Management** - Monitor sentiment and maintain consistent brand voice

## Approach

Using the `engagements.csv` dataset containing Instagram post metadata and user comments from March 2025, we will:

- **Define metrics & visualize** to measure performance and track progress
- **Provide insights** about customer behavior and preferences for each goal area
- **Generate actionable feedback** for social media strategy optimization

The analysis bridges marketing intent with customer reality, enabling data-driven decisions that move business metrics beyond vanity engagement numbers.

## Insights & Feedback

### Brand Awareness & Reach

• **Giveaways are 4x more effective for reach amplification** - Regular posts average 50 comments while giveaway posts average 201 comments, representing a massive organic reach multiplier (*Giveaway vs Regular post performance* chart). **Recommendation:** Increase giveaway frequency and treat them as reach investments, not just promotional tactics.

• **Prime engagement window identified** - Peak activity occurs at 7-8 PM (2,113 and 1,502 comments respectively), providing optimal timing for maximum visibility (*Hourly Engagement Distribution* chart). **Recommendation:** Schedule key announcements, product launches, and time-sensitive campaigns for this window.

• **Viral potential demonstrated** - March 21st generated 3,499 comments in a single day, proving the brand can achieve breakthrough engagement when conditions align (*Daily Engagement Pattern* chart). **Recommendation:** Reverse-engineer what content/strategy drove this spike and systematically replicate those elements.

• **Content hierarchy for reach** - Top-performing individual posts generated 1,200-5,700 comments each, with giveaways dominating the leaderboard (*Top 10 Posts by Comment Count* chart). **Recommendation:** Establish engagement benchmarks using 50-comment baseline for regular posts and 200+ for giveaways as performance targets for reach optimization.
