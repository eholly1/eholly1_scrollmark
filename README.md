# @treehut Social Media Analytics Project

## Project Goals

This project analyzes Instagram engagement data for @treehut to provide actionable insights across five key social media management objectives:

• **Brand Awareness & Reach** - Grow follower base and expand brand visibility in the beauty/skincare space

• **Community Building & Engagement** - Foster loyal customer relationships and create authentic product conversations

• **Sales & Conversion** - Drive traffic and convert social engagement into purchases

• **Customer Insights & Feedback** - Gather product feedback and identify market expansion opportunities

• **Brand Reputation Management** - Monitor sentiment and maintain consistent brand voice

## Approach

Using the `engagements.csv` dataset containing Instagram post metadata and user comments from March 2025, we will:

- **Define metrics & visualize** to measure performance and track progress
- **Provide insights** about customer behavior and preferences for each goal area
- **Generate actionable feedback** for social media strategy optimization

The analysis bridges marketing intent with customer reality, enabling data-driven decisions that move business metrics beyond vanity engagement numbers.
