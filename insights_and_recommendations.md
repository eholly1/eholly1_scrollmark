## Customer Insights & Recommendations

• **Berry scents represent massive untapped demand** - Only 2 berry-scented posts generated 45 comments per post, the highest engagement rate of any scent category, indicating significant market opportunity. **Recommendation:** Prioritize berry scent line expansion and test market response with limited releases.

• **Product category hierarchy reveals customer preferences** - Lotions (29.8 comments/post) and oils (23.2 comments/post) significantly outperform scrubs (15.9 comments/post), suggesting customers prioritize hydration over exfoliation. **Recommendation:** Shift product development and marketing focus toward moisturizing products.

• **International expansion opportunity clearly signaled** - Customer comments explicitly request product availability in other markets, with Canada being the most frequently mentioned. **Recommendation:** Conduct market research for international expansion, starting with Canada.

• **Vanilla market saturation evident** - Despite 40 vanilla-related posts, engagement averages only 7.9 comments per post, the lowest among major scent categories, indicating customer fatigue. **Recommendation:** Reduce vanilla content frequency and explore fresh scent profiles to re-energize the product line.

## Sales & Conversion

• **Include Conversion Data in Analysis** - While product performance (lotions: 29.8 comments/post vs scrubs: 15.9 comments/post) and scent preferences (berry: 45 comments/post) suggest conversion opportunities, the core hypothesis that engagement correlates with sales needs validation. **Recommendation:** Integrate actual conversion data by tracking Instagram traffic with UTM parameters, measuring sales performance of high-engagement products, and correlating social campaigns with purchase behavior to validate or refine engagement-based strategies.
