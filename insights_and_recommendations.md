## Brand Awareness & Reach

• **Strategic post types drive exponential reach** - PR recruitment posts (3,294 comments) and giveaways (201 avg) vastly outperform regular content (50 avg), with opportunity-based content generating the highest engagement. **Recommendation:** Balance content calendar with regular giveaways and periodic PR/influencer recruitment campaigns.

## Customer Insights & Recommendations

• **Berry scents represent massive untapped demand** - Only 2 berry-scented posts generated 45 comments per post, the highest engagement rate of any scent category, indicating significant market opportunity. **Recommendation:** Prioritize berry scent line expansion and test market response with limited releases.

• **Product category hierarchy reveals customer preferences** - Lotions (29.8 comments/post) and oils (23.2 comments/post) significantly outperform scrubs (15.9 comments/post), suggesting customers prioritize hydration over exfoliation. **Recommendation:** Shift product development and marketing focus toward moisturizing products.

• **International expansion opportunity clearly signaled** - Customer comments explicitly request product availability in other markets, with Canada being the most frequently mentioned. **Recommendation:** Conduct market research for international expansion, starting with Canada.

• **Vanilla market saturation evident** - Despite 40 vanilla-related posts, engagement averages only 7.9 comments per post, the lowest among major scent categories, indicating customer fatigue. **Recommendation:** Reduce vanilla content frequency and explore fresh scent profiles to re-energize the product line.

## Sales & Conversion

• **Include Conversion Data in Analysis** - While product performance (lotions: 29.8 comments/post vs scrubs: 15.9 comments/post) and scent preferences (berry: 45 comments/post) suggest conversion opportunities, the core hypothesis that engagement correlates with sales needs validation. **Recommendation:** Integrate actual conversion data by tracking Instagram traffic with UTM parameters, measuring sales performance of high-engagement products, and correlating social campaigns with purchase behavior to validate or refine engagement-based strategies.

## Brand Reputation Management

• **Overall brand sentiment requires attention** - Analysis of customer comments reveals 33.5% positive, 2.5% negative, and 64% neutral sentiment, resulting in a brand health score of 31.5/100. While negative sentiment is low, the high neutral percentage suggests missed opportunities for emotional connection. **Recommendation:** Focus on content that drives genuine positive emotional responses rather than just engagement volume.

• **Content quality drives positive sentiment more than post type** - Posts achieving 100% positive sentiment focused on specific product benefits ("formulated to give you soft hands"), community connection ("self-care girlies"), and interactive engagement ("How many did you get right?"), regardless of whether they were giveaways. **Recommendation:** Prioritize content specificity and community language over generic promotional posts.

• **Product-focused messaging generates strongest positive response** - Posts highlighting formulation details, specific product benefits, and individual product spotlights consistently achieved perfect positive sentiment scores. **Recommendation:** Increase educational content about product ingredients, benefits, and usage rather than lifestyle-only content.
  - *See: Post Sentiment Scores chart*

• **Giveaways require sentiment validation alongside engagement metrics** - While giveaways drive 4x higher comment volume, sentiment analysis is needed to confirm they generate positive brand perception rather than just transactional engagement. **Recommendation:** Monitor sentiment quality of giveaway comments to ensure they build brand affinity, not just follower count.
